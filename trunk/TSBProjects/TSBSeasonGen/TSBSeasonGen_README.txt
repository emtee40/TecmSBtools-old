TSBSeasonGen README

Requirements:
Microsoft.NET framework 1.1 or Microsoft.NET framework 2.0
You can obtain the .NET framework from Microsoft for free by going to 
http://www.dotnetgerman.com/links/dl_distri.asp

If you are a programmer and do not have the .NET framework installed, you may want to
consider downloading the .NET sdk or a Visual Studio express version. 
It's also a free download from Microsoft.

You may also want to take a look at Lutz Roeder's .NET Reflector (This program can 
disassemble the .NET byte code and display a close representation of the source code 
of a .NET program [View->Disassembler]).


====================================================================================
Version 2.0 

Defects Fixed:
1. Defensive Players sim horribly (for sacks and interceptions).
   - This was because the sum for Sim PI and sim Pass rush for a teams' defenders
     is supposed to add up to 255 (a tidbit I did not know when I released the original).


Features Added:
1. New GUI which allows you to easily select which teams you want.
   - Three ways to specify a team.
      1. By Year.        [1990]
      2. By Substitution [1988 bills]
      3. By file         [C:\myFiles\Stuff\Junk\DATA\2006\BoiseState.txt]
          The 'By File' method was added for the purposes because I wanted the ability to
          specify non-nfl teams. But I do not have any 'Release' quality data files for other
          leagues to really make it useful.
2. create a config file through the GUI.
   - Simply fill out the 'Form' how you want it, and click 'Save Config File'.
3. Load Data from a config file.
   - Simply click "Load Config File" and select the file you wish to load. the GUI will populate
     with data from the file.

To generate a season based on a year:
1. Enter the year in the 'Schedule' text box.
2. Select the 'Generate season based on year' check box.
3. Click 'Generate Season'.


=============================== About ================================================
This program reads text files in a certain format and generates output to be read by the
TSBTool program (to be applied to a Tecmo Super Bowl ROM).
This tool was created because I thought it would be neat to just specify a year and have
the NFL season for that year auto generated so that a user could play through the specified season
in a football video game. Tecmo Super Bowl was the chosen target because it was fairly well known
how to modify the ROM. Originally, I had planned to target NFL2K5 (Xbox) but that would have
taken a long time for me to figure out.

The files used by this program to generate nfl seasons for TSBTool are in the 
"NFL_DATA" directory. These files are human readable plain text files. You can make a player
'Good' in a given season by pumping up their stats.

The data in the text files was taken from http://jt-sw.com/football/pro/rosters.nsf.

============================== Usage ================================================
# From command line
# Generate the file for the 1985 season.
TSBSeasonGen 1985 > 1985_TSBTool_data.txt
 or 
TSBSeasonGen 1985 | TSBTool -stdin -out:1985.nes input_rom.nes

# Generate a season with the configuration specified in 'configFile.txt'
TSBSeasonGen -config:configFile.txt > special_TSBToolData.txt
 or
TSBSeasonGen -config:configFile.txt | TSBTool -stdin -out:special.nes input_rom.nes

============================== Config File ===========================================
There is a sample config file (ConfigFile.txt) included with this program.

"SCHEDULE=1995"
Specifies that you want to use the 1995 schedule.

In the config file you can specify a certain year for a team.
"2002 49ers"
Specifies that you want the 49ers to have their roster from the 2002 season

"cardinals = 2000 ravens"
Specifies that you want to replace the cardinals with the '2000 ravens'

=========================== Special files =========================================
Two important files:
1. TSB_Data\NumberFaceData.txt
2. TSB_Data\AttributeMap.txt

NumberFaceData.txt is a file that you can place 'Face' and jersey number mappings into.
These jersey numbers take precedence over anything in the 'NFL_DATA\<year>\<team name>.txt' files.
The face will be applied to the specified player.
If the player is in the file twice, only the first occurrence will be taken into account.

In the AttributeMap.txt file you can specify attributes for players. The data in this file
takes precedence over anything generated by the program. You can also specify only certain
attributes for a player.
Lets say that John Elway had an off year, and his Attributes were rated quite low.
You know he has a rocket arm, but since the program only assigns attributes off of
stats, Elway ends up with throwing power of 25.
You can fix this a couple different ways.
1.  Specify All of John Elway's attributes.
     QB1, john ELWAY, 25, 69, 38, 13, 75, 56, 69, 50 ,[11, 9, 0 ]

2. Or you can specify only certain attributes and let the program assign the rest.
     QB1, john ELWAY, ?, ?, 38, ?, 75, ?, ?, 50 ,[?, ?, ? ]
    
The '?' characters tell the program to use what it calculates for that attribute, the
numbers (in this case) indicate to the program that we want Elway to have 38 Max Speed, 
75 passing speed, and 50 avoid pass block points.

============================ Defects =============================================
At the time of this writing I don't know of any defects in this program.
This program has defects in it, I just haven't found them yet. If you find them
post your findings in a thread in the forums at www.knobbe.org .


=========================== Data Generated =======================================
The data generated by this program (applied to a ROM via TSBTool.exe) is not 'Top-Quality'.
Many of the players will not have the correct jersey numbers or correct skin color/face.

If you want to make a 'Quality' ROM you need to make sure that most of the players
have the correct skin color and jersey number.
This data is not easy to come by. I looked many times for this data and could not
find much. The skin color and jersey number data that this program does know
about was mostly taken from various 'Top-Quality' modified ROMS (and the Original 
TSB).
